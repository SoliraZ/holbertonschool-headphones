# Headphones Website Project

## Project Overview

This project is a **design-to-code implementation challenge**. You have been provided with a design file (similar to receiving a design from a designer) and all the necessary assets/images. Your task is to recreate the website exactly as shown in the design using HTML and CSS.

## What You Have


### Design Preview
Below is the design you need to recreate. Study it carefully to understand the layout, colors, typography, and all visual elements:

The design shows:
- The complete layout and structure
- Color schemes and typography
- Spacing, margins, and padding
- Responsive breakpoints

## Your Task

### Main Objective
Recreate the headphones website **pixel-perfect** based on the provided design file. This means:
1. **Match the design exactly** - Colors, fonts, spacing, layout
2. **Use semantic HTML** - Proper HTML5 elements and structure
3. **Write clean CSS** - Well-organized, maintainable stylesheets
4. **Make it responsive** - Ensure it works on different screen sizes
5. **Follow best practices** - Use what you've learned about web development

### What You Need to Do

1. **Analyze the Design**
   - Study the design file carefully
   - Identify all sections (header, hero, features, footer, etc.)
   - Note colors, fonts, spacing, and layout patterns
   - Understand the responsive behavior at different breakpoints

2. **Plan Your Structure**
   - Create an HTML structure using semantic elements
   - Plan your CSS organization (consider using separate files for different sections)
   - Identify reusable components and patterns

3. **Build the HTML**
   - Create `index.html` with proper document structure
   - Use semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.)
   - Include proper meta tags, title, and favicon
   - Link to your CSS files

4. **Style with CSS**
   - Create CSS file(s) to style your HTML
   - Match colors, typography, and spacing from the design
   - Implement responsive design (mobile-first approach recommended)
   - Add hover states and transitions where shown in the design
   - Use the provided images in the correct locations

5. **Test and Refine**
   - Test on different browsers
   - Check responsive behavior at various screen sizes
   - Compare your implementation with the design file
   - Make adjustments to achieve pixel-perfect accuracy

## Best Practices to Apply

- **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate HTML5 semantic elements
- **CSS Organization**: Keep your CSS organized and maintainable
- **Responsive Design**: Use media queries for different screen sizes
- **Performance**: Optimize images and code
- **Accessibility**: Use proper alt text for images, semantic markup
- **Code Quality**: Write clean, readable, and well-commented code
- **File Structure**: Organize your files logically

## Project Structure

Your final project should have a structure similar to:

```
holbertonschool-headphones/
├── images/
│   ├── favicon.png
│   ├── headphones_hero_1.jpg
│   ├── headphones_hero_2.jpg
│   ├── logo_headphones.png
│   └── pentagone.png
├── index.html
├── styles.css (or styles/ directory with multiple CSS files)
└── README.md
```

## Tips

1. **Start with the structure**: Build your HTML first, then style it
2. **Work section by section**: Complete one section at a time
3. **Use browser DevTools**: Inspect elements and test responsive behavior
4. **Reference the design file frequently**: Keep it open while coding
5. **Pay attention to details**: Spacing, alignment, and typography matter
6. **Test early and often**: Don't wait until the end to test responsiveness

## Remember

This project is about demonstrating your ability to:
- Translate a visual design into working code
- Write semantic, accessible HTML
- Create well-structured, maintainable CSS
- Implement responsive design principles
- Pay attention to detail and achieve pixel-perfect accuracy

Good luck! 🎧
